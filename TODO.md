1. [Chouette](http://www.bkgm.com/variants/Chouette-ABA.html),
   like I used to play Backgammon in college.
   * One player is "the box".
   * The box plays against everyone else.
   * Wins and losses are "times n" for the box.
   * One of the other players, the "captain", makes decisions, the others advise.
   * If the captain wins, he becomes the box, and the current box moves to the
   back of the line of players.
   * Need a private chat for the players, exclusing the box.
   Probably a check-box. On desktop, it could be side-by-side chat areas.
   * Doubling cube?
   * When a person creates a new game, they decide it will be a chouette,
   A public chouette can be joined at any time, but that player will only
   watch until the next game starts.
   The game starter may ban any player who is not currently part of a game.

1. Placement mode checkbox
   * One click to select a node.
   * Used to make sample layouts.
